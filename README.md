# YT-Downloader-GUI--pp-

## About:

Independent project. For Python learning purposes. pp: pure python.

Download YouTube videos with YT-Downloader-GUI-pp.

The project is fully implemented in tcl (although its libraries use Tcl).

YT-Downloader-GUI-pp ONLY downloads videos, for now. Please, do not insert a playlist URL on the software console.

But it's possible that, in the future, downloading playlists will also be something that YT-Downloader can do.
